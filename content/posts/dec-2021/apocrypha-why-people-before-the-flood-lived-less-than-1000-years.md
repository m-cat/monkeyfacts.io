The apocryphal Book of Jubilees gives an intriguing explanation as to why Adam and many others before the flood lived less than 1000 years:

> And [Adam] lacked seventy years of one thousand years; for one thousand years are as one day in the testimony of the heavens and therefore was it written concerning the tree of knowledge: "On the day that ye eat thereof ye will die."
