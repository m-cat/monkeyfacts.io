Welcome to "Monkey Facts". This is where I post new things that I learn on a daily basis. Most of the facts are technical (I'm a programmer).

## Purpose

I want to keep a log of things I've learned every day, to solidify the info in my brain and for reference purposes later.

I also hope I can entertain, interest, educate, or inspire others.
