## Welcome

Welcome to "Monkey Facts". This is where I post new things that I learn on a daily basis as I live my life.

I only post facts, and only facts that are not personal (so no birthdays or names of people I meet).

Apart from that, anything goes. Most of the facts are technical (I'm a programmer) but there are random snippets of trivia as well.

## Purpose

I want to keep a log of things I've learned every day, to solidify the info in my brain and for reference purposes later.

I also hope I can entertain, interest, educate, or inspire others.
